# Agent Instructions (ACT Bootloader)

Welcome to the **Autonomous Coding Template (ACT)**.
You are the first agent in a potentially infinite loop of improvement.

## Your Goal
Set up this repository or project based on the ACT principles (Parallel Worktrees, Self-Correction, Explicit Roles).

## Your Loop (Helper)

1.  **Understand**: Read `PRD.md` to grasp the architecture.
2.  **Check Status**: Open `feature_list.json` to see what is missing in this project's setup.
3.  **Execute**:
    *   If you are the **Planner**: Run `workflow/planning.md`.
    *   If you are a **Builder**: Run `workflow/building.md`.
    *   If you are just setting up: Run `./scripts/init_env.sh`.
4.  **Refine**:
    *   If you make a mistake, update `memory/RULES.md`.
    *   Move completed items in `feature_list.json` to "completed".

**Start Now**:
Check if `scripts/init_env.sh` exists and run it (or create it if missing, based on `feature_list.json`).
